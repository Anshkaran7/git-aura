## How to Raise an Issue

Found a bug or want a new feature? Here's how to tell us:

1. **Search first** - Look at existing issues to see if someone already reported it
2. **Click "New issue"** - Use the green button on the issues page
3. **Choose type** - Pick "Bug report" or "Feature request"
4. **Write title** - Use format like `bug: login button not working` or `feat: add dark mode`
5. **Fill details** - Include:
   - What you expected to happen
   - What actually happened
   - Steps to reproduce (step by step)
   - Your device info (OS, browser, etc.)
6. **Add screenshots** - If you can, add pictures or code examples
7. **Mention if you want to work on it** - Say "I'd like to work on this" if you want to fix it

**Good issue example:**

```
