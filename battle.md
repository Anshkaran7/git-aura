## 🚀 Overview

This document summarizes all the major changes made to enhance the Battle Profile feature in GitAura, including improved metrics, bug fixes, and UI/UX upgrades for a more competitive and informative GitHub battle experience.

## ✨ Features & Enhancements

### 1. **Expanded Metrics for Battle**

- **Followers** and **Following** counts
- **Total Issues** opened by the user
- **Total Merged Pull Requests**
- **Total Contributions** (commits, PRs, issues, etc.)
- **Total Public Repositories**
- **Total Public Gists**
- **Total Stars** (sum of stargazer counts from all public repos)
- **Aura Score** (composite score based on activity, streaks, and quality)

### 2. **Backend Improvements**

- Updated the GitHub GraphQL query to fetch all relevant metrics, including:
  - Followers, following, issues, pull requests (with nodes), repositories (with stargazerCount), gists, and pinned items.
- Summed up stargazer counts from all public repositories for the **Total Stars** metric.
- Added detailed PR node extraction for future UI enhancements.
- Fixed bug where missing contribution weeks would break the API.
- Ensured all metrics are always present, even if some data is missing from GitHub.

### 3. **Aura Score Calculation**

- Fixed Aura calculation to use all available contributions.
- Added server-side calculation and inclusion of Aura in the internal API response.
- The battle API now fetches Aura directly from the internal API for accuracy.

### 4. **Battle Result Table & Comparison Logic**

- Added **Issues Raised** and **PRs Merged** as core metrics in the battle result table.
- Added icons for all metrics (🐞 for issues, ✅ for PRs merged, etc.).
- Removed "Account Age" from the battle result table for clarity.
- Improved winner logic for each metric.

### 5. **UI/UX Enhancements**

- Updated the battle profile section to display all new metrics with clear labels and icons.
- Ensured the UI gracefully handles missing or partial data.
- Added helpful error messages and loading states.

## 📈 How It Works

1. **Data Fetching:**
   - Uses GitHub GraphQL API to fetch all relevant user stats in one query.
   - Sums up stars and collects PR/issue data for comparison.
2. **Aura Calculation:**
   - Calculated server-side and included in the API response for accuracy.
3. **Battle Comparison:**
   - Compares all metrics, determines winners, and displays results with icons and explanations.
